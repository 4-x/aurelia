# Joining the Community

Welcome to the Aurelia community! This documentation on Aurelia 2 is still preliminary, but that doesn't mean you can't jump in and join us in building the world's most loved JavaScript framework.

To get started working with us, please first read our [code of conduct](./code-of-conduct) and our [contributor guide](./contributor-guide). After that, if you want to contribute to the source code of Aurelia, its tools, or its plugins, have a read through [building and testing Aurelia](./building-and-testing-aurelia). If you'd like to contribute to our documentation, then please take a look at [writing documentation](./writing-documentation).

We look forward to working together with you!
