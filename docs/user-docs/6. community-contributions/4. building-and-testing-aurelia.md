# Building and Testing Aurelia

## Monorepo Setup

After Git cloning this repo, run the following commands once, to get things setup:

* `npm ci`
* `npm run bootstrap`

These two commands install locked dependencies and then setup Lerna, which symlinks local packages and hoists all shared dependencies to the root.

## Building

Once these steps have completed, you should build the entire monorepo with this command:

* `npm run build`

## Testing

To develop while running tests, you will need two console windows. In one console window, run the following command to build and put the monorepo in dev mode:

* `npm run dev`

Next, open a second console window, and change directory to the tests projects:

* `cd packages/__tests__`

From within this directory, you can run tests in a variety of ways:

* `npm run test-node` - Run all tests in Node.js.
* `npm run test-chrome` - Run all tests in Chrome.
* `npm run test-chrome:watch` - Run all tests in Chrome with watch mode enabled.
* `npm run test-chrome:debugger` - Run all tests in Chrome with the debugger enabled.

See the `package.json` file within the `__tests__` project for additional test-related commands.
