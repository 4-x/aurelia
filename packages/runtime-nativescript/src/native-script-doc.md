```
NativeScript applications consist of pages that represent the separate application screens.

Pages are instances of the Page class from the Page module. To navigate between pages, you can use the methods of the Frame module. This article will provides guidelines for creating and accessing pages, using page events with the related event data and implementing page navigation.
